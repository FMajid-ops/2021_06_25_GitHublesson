# Hi 
# Learning Github Commands


**Repo to local**
* git clone (clone repo name) 
This will bring file to local storage. All of the files in the folder
* git pull 
This will bring all the changes that are in repo to local folder. Similar to git clone


**Status**
* git status 
provides information on what files are good for staging

**Local to repo**
* git add . 

adds everything to the staging area
* git commit -m "some description"

confirms the staging area file to be shipped out
* git push -u origin master

moves the staged files to repo. Note the key word master is not working for me. Use main 
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b


**Branching**
